This is a full-stack web application designed to automate and simplify the complex process of creating and managing work schedules. The project tackles the challenges of manual scheduling by offering a powerful algorithm for automatic staff assignment and an intuitive interface for manual adjustments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Automatic Schedule Generation:** The core of the application is a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes employee availability, constraints, position requirements, and legal rules to generate an optimized weekly schedule with a single click.
-   **Drag & Drop Manual Editor:** For fine-tuning and handling exceptions, managers have access to an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to manually assign or re-assign employees to different shifts.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Clear separation of permissions for **Admins** (full system control) and **Employees** (viewing their schedule, submitting constraints).
-   **Employee Constraints Management:** Employees can submit their work preferences and unavailability, which are automatically factored into the schedule generation process.
-   **Core System Configuration:** Flexible setup of multiple **Work Sites**, **Positions**, and **Shifts**, allowing the system to be tailored to the specific needs of any organization.
-   **JWT Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens, ensuring protected routes and data.
-   **Responsive Design:** The user interface is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
The frontend is architected using the **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** methodology. This modern approach provides:
-   **High Scalability:** New features can be added in isolation without affecting existing code.
-   **Strong Modularity:** A clear and logical separation of code into layers (`shared`, `entities`, `features`, `widgets`).
-   **Excellent Maintainability:** The codebase is easy to navigate, understand, and debug.

### Backend
The backend follows a classic **Layered Architecture** pattern, separating concerns into distinct modules:
-   **Routes:** Define the API endpoints and direct incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controllers.
-   **Controllers:** Handle request validation and data extraction, then call the relevant service logic. They are responsible for formatting and sending the HTTP response.
-   **Services:** Contain all the core business logic, including the complex schedule generation algorithm. They interact with the database via the Sequelize ORM.
-   **Models:** Define the database schema and relationships using Sequelize.

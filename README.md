Shifts App is a full-stack web application designed to automate and simplify the complex process of managing employee
work schedules.

### 🎯 About The Project

Shifts App solves a common problem for managers: the time-consuming and error-prone task of manually creating and
adjusting work schedules. It provides a centralized platform for administrators to build schedules intelligently and for
employees to view their assignments and manage their requests.

### ✨ Key Features

* 🧠 **Intelligent Schedule Generation:** Automatically create optimized schedules based on employee availability and
  pre-defined shift requirements, saving hours of manual work.
* ↔️ **Drag & Drop Interface:** A modern, intuitive calendar interface allows administrators to easily make manual
  adjustments and reassign shifts.
* 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control:** A secure authentication system with distinct roles and permissions for *
  *Administrators** and **Employees**.
* 📊 **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:** Manage employees, configure work sites and positions, and oversee all scheduling
  operations from a single control panel.
* 👤 **Employee Self-Service Portal:** Empowers employees to view their personal schedules, submit time-off requests, and
  track their work hours.
